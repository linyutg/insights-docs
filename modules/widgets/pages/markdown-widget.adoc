== HTML Restrictions

The `<iframe>` tag is subject to security restrictions and cannot:

* Have embedded websites that violate the `same-origin policy`.
* Have X-Frame-Options set to `DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN`.
* Have `Content-Security-Policy` headers that disallow embedding.

=== Same-origin policy restriction
The `<iframe>` tag follows the `same-origin policy`, which means it can only embed websites that have the same `protocol`, `host`, and `port` as the page containing the `<iframe>`.

If the embedded website doesn't meet the `same-origin` requirements, the browser will block its loading.

=== X-Frame-Options header
Websites can control whether they can be embedded in `<iframe>` tags by setting the `X-Frame-Options` header in their responses.
If a website sets `X-Frame-Options` to `DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN`, the browser will refuse to load the website within an `<iframe>`.

=== Content-Security-Policy header
Websites can define security policies, including whether they allow embedding in `<iframe>` tags, by setting the `Content-Security-Policy` header.
